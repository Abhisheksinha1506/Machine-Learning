27/10/2019, 10:29 am - Ipsita: आई दिवाली

देखो आई दिवाली
चहरे पर खुशी की लाली।
सदियों से चली आ रही ये रीत
अंधकार पर प्रकाश की जीत।
अग्यानता को ग्यान ने हराया,
धर्म के समक्ष अधर्म ना टिक पाया।

सिया-राम, लक्ष्मण, हनुमान सहित अयोध्या पधारे,
चौदह वर्ष थे इन्होंने वन में गुज़ारे।
अयोध्या में खुशी और उल्लास है छाया
अयोध्या वासियों ने सुख का दीप जलाया।

पुनः अधर्म को धर्म ने भगाया दूर
श्री कृष्ण के हाथों नष्ट हुआ नर्कासुर।
देवी माँ के दो रूपों को करते हैं आज स्मरण
एक माँ लक्ष्मी, धन दाता, दूसरा माँ काली जो करे पाप का हरण।

आओ आज हम सब भेद भाव भुलाये
अओ सब मिलकर दीप जलाएं।
दुख के अंधकार को दूर भगाएं
आओ खुशी के दियें जलाएं।


आप सभी को दिवाली की शुभकामनाएं।
 Wishing you all a very happy Diwali.

15/11/2019, 11:34 am - Poonam Ma'am: Hi Guru - 

I need to communicate the following to the FT students in Pune. Can you please do so on my behalf?

1) The exam papers will be based on the material covered in the class. (A lot of students have asked me if it will be based on material covered in class or the textbook.)

2) The syllabus has been covered almost entirely in the class. One minor topic that I have not been able to cover is Low Budget Product Marketing Ideas. The students need to read various blogs on this topic.

3) I also wanted to show examples of budget templates and sales collateral but I ran out of time. Students need to study these further from various blogs. The basic material has been covered in class.

4) For further market research and analysis case studies, they need to refer to the textbook. The textbook has a few case studies, and also comes with an addendum called "Indian Cases". The students need to read this addendum. 

Thanks, and regards.

Vivek

26/01/2020, 7:21 pm - Guru: https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasudev-murthy-cp-apmp-3113661/  

Hi everyone

I look forward to meeting you all on the *27th of Jan* .

I will introduce myself more formally when we meet, but at this time, I would like to say that I have a lot of industry and teaching experience, which I hope to share with you.

To make this a mutually useful experience, I would like to lay down a few rules.

I am generally a high-energy person and will expect 100% and more from you in the classroom.  Therefore

1. Exercise well before coming to the class. Dress well.
2. Please be at your seat 5 minutes before the start.
3. Using mobile phones for any reason is prohibited. I will consider it a breach of class discipline if I find anyone using it. Please switch off your mobile and keep it away safely.
4. Participate actively and ask me lots of questions.
5. Smile and laugh a lot.
6. Connect with me over LinkedIn before the class.

Best wishes
Vasudev Murthy

 *Please be in the classroom by 9:15 AM.*

Greetings and hope you are all doing fine. Kindly note that this is a final reminder for fee payments. If we do not receive payment by Wednesday, all access will be blocked and there will be a 30k collect for re-initiation of the same. Request you all to take this seriously. It is indeed appalling the Balu has had to send so many reminders regarding the same. The instructions have been passed on to your program managers regarding the same.  Those who have paid, kindly ignore this message. Your immediate action and response would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Dear Poonam:
Kindly block all access after 48 hours for all defaulters. Thank you.

Regards,
Kavitha Srinivasan
Director of Customer Excellence.

Kindly note that your feedback helps us to assess our faculty and provide you with a great customer experience in terms of your learning and industry connect.  Hence, I request you all to ensure that feedback is given before you leave the class and avoid the program managers having to follow up with you later.  It is for your benefit and I hope you understand the same.  It also gives you the opportunity to question us regarding any lapses if you have informed us and given us a feedback, without which there would also be no basis of knowing what you feel.  I hope I will have complete cooperation from all of you about this.  I wish you all a great week ahead and good luck with your course.  Kindly reach out to me on kay.s@ipl.edu.in for any queries or concerns.  Take care.  Best regards, Kavitha Srinivasan

I composed this very simple piece in Raga Shuddha Sarang and distributed it amongst 6 different friends from Roorkee across the world.  3 vocalists in San Francisco, Dubai and Patna.  3 instrumentalists in Bangalore, Lucknow and Noida. Each played their assigned pieces and sent it to someone who stitched the whole thing together seamlessly. Let me know what you think and whether we could do this in this group.

This kind of behavior is not appreciated at all.

17/10/2020, 9:36 am - Neelima: Hi @919686890779 @918884446840 @919606197549

Pls note , we the data science students have classes for ML, deep learning, big data , entrepreneurship as well and we have different projects in each subject. 
Along with that we are having multiple assignments, projects,presentations each week and the time of class is not fixed. 
We arent able to revise the concepts before next class and its getting really difficult to manage everything. 
1) It would be great help if we could get a calendar for the classes so that we have a better clarity in our mind for the classes and can plan accordingly. 
2) We want the notes on haiku to be updated just after the class, the late updation troubles a lot as the some time we have is all gone in asking for the notes and then we arent getting time for revision due to non-availability of the notes on time.
3) We would be able to relate much with the class if we have the pre redings or the knowledge about the topic which would be covered, it would be a great help if you could also look into this aspect.
4) We need breaks as well for self study as we arent able to relate much with the classes due to non revision and working on assignments .

Thanks

_(Please Note: Your internship viva voce, will be conducted online & questions will be asked from the internship reports you have submitted to us. Kindly join the session at 10 am sharp. The order for viva-voce will be announced tomorrow morning at 8 am.)_
28/10/2020, 8:35 am - Neelima: Good Morning @919686890779 @919606197549 @918884446840

I would like to inform you that i have just checked haiku till now not a single subject is uploaded completely with study material for us to study.  We DS students just have a single day for revising the concepts and classes and we dnt want the day to go un-utilized. 
Even after multiple reminders its not done for any of the subject neither deep learning , Nor ML , Nor big data. 
If their is some issue with haiku , 
It would be great if you could mail us the study material directly so that we can study and utilise the day effectively.🙏🏻🙏🏻

As technology Management has 3 subjects (devops, cloud computing, software architecture) to cover and there was no subjects included in that calendar and as you said there was final exams in December so can you please provide the details of remaining subjects when all these are going to cover with the as per circular, please don’t make to teach all the subjects at one day like DS students are facing we can’t able to grasp all the knowledge at once.

We are having our midterm exams according to the University and all the subjects are listed according to the syllabus submitted to the University.

05/01/2021, 8:55 am - IPL Sai Sunder: *A Note on Examination Preparation from Prof. Kishan Malur*

Dear Class, 
First of all wishing you all a very happy new year. May the new year bring all the happiness to you and your family. 

I am writing this to wish you all the very best for your Examination in the next few weeks. I am hoping you are all preparing well for the same. 

For my subject, I wanted to share some general advice to you to prepare better. 

1. Please ensure you go through the class presentations very well for preparation. 
2. In the exam, ensure you write proportionately to the marks allocated to the question. 
3. At the same time, when you write long answers, ensure you give proper paragraph headings to your answers

Wish you all the best again! Hope you do well. 

*Prof. Kishan Malur*

16/01/2021, 1:11 pm - Shahid: Hi Good Afternoon @919606197549
On Monday we have Software Architecture and Solution Architecture paper, as this is a vast subject and we cannot able to cover whole 90 marks in 3 hour 15 minutes.
As you have said that we have a time of 3 hours 30 minutes to complete the exam, but invigilator is allowing only for 3 hours 15 minutes, but to write whole paper for 90 marks we need atleast 3 hours 45 minutes for this paper. 
So i request you to provide more time for examination
Thanks,
Shahid shaik
